1. Solder wires onto speaker. Wires should be long enough to go past the board module section from the speaker. Feed speaker wires through speaker backplate and insert into speaker housing. Fit speaker housing onto rails by pulling battery module rails apart. Attach secondary rails to main rails by squeezing board module rails together.
2. Solder wires to battery contacts. Positive wire should be long enough to be soldered to NeoPixel PCB, negative wire should go past board module section. Insert contacts into battery tray. Feed speaker wires through battery tray. Fit battery tray onto rails by flexing battery tray into place. There should be four wires coming from the battery tray to the board module.
3. Solder all wires to soundboard. Button wires should lead to a connecter to detach button later. The recharge port is right under the board, so wires should be shorter for that. If doing TriCree, solder wires to Cree and install heatsink onto rails BEFORE soldering wires to soundboard. Insert recharge port (port facing down) into board module (popsickle stick may be helpful). Clip board into place. Insert board module into rails.
4. For NeoPixel, clip PCB in place from the back.
